      <h1>Running any NPM package in the browser locally</h1>
      <p>JavaScript has never had any official solution for distributing
        packages, and every web platform (Rails, Django etc) has their own
        idea of how to structure and package JavaScript. In the last few years
        NPM has started becoming the canonical way of distribution, with
        Webpack as the build system, but thereâ€™s no way to load NPM packages
        in the browser without a server-side component.</p>
